## Introduction

Seamless View provides an integration of the payment process directly on your
website. This solution offers a smooth shopping experience with Swedbank Pay
Payments seamlessly integrated in an `iframe` on your website. The payer
does not need to leave your webpage, since we are handling the payment in the
`iframe` on your website.

## Step 1: Create the payment

A Trustly payment is a straightforward way to perform a direct-bank payment. It can be followed up by posting a cancellation or reversal
transaction.

An example of an abbreviated `POST` request is provided below.
Each individual field of the JSON document is described in the following section.
An example of an expanded `POST` request is available in [Payment resource]
[payment-resource].

When properly set up in your merchant/webshop site and the payer starts the
payment process, you need to make a `POST` request towards Swedbank Pay with your
payment information. This will generate a `payment` resource with a unique
`id` URI. You will receive a **JavaScript source** in response.

}
```

The key information in the response is the `view-sales` operation. You
will need to embed its `href` in a `<script>` element. The script will enable
loading the payment page in an `iframe` in our next step.

## Step 2: Display the Payment

You need to embed the script source on your site to create a Seamless View in an
`iframe`; so that the payer can enter the payment details in a secure Swedbank Pay
hosted environment. A simplified integration has these following steps:

1.  Create a container that will contain the Seamless View iframe: `<div
    id="swedbank-pay-seamless-view-page">`.
2.  Create a `<script>` source within the container. Embed the `href` value
    obtained in the `POST` request in the `<script>` element. Example:

```html
    <script id="payment-page-script" src="https://ecom.externalintegration.payex.com/trustly/core/ scripts/client/px.trustly.client.js"></script>
```

The previous two steps gives this HTML:

{:.code-header}
**HTML**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Swedbank Pay Seamless View is Awesome!</title>
        <!-- Here you can specify your own javascript file -->
        <script src=<YourJavaScriptFileHere>></script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div id="swedbank-pay-seamless-view-page">
          <script id="payment-page-script" src="https://ecom.externalintegration.payex.com/trustly/core/scripts/client/px.trustly.client.js"></script>
        </div>
    </body>
</html>
```

Lastly, initiate the Seamless View with a JavaScript call to open the `iframe`
embedded on your website.

{:.code-header}
**JavaScript**

```js
<script language="javascript">
    payex.hostedView.trustly({
        // The container specifies which id the script will look for to host the
        // iframe component.
        container: "swedbank-pay-seamless-view-page"
    }).open();
</script>
```
